# Who Am I?

My name is Kyle Green. I'm an ambitious veteran with an interesting background in client analytics, programming, and naval nuclear power. I started programming on my own ten years ago with C. After joining the Navy I took a break from programming and focused on nuclear propulsion. Since leaving, I've been programming in Python, even more so in the Data Science course that I took at Codeup.

I'm always on the lookout for interesting projects, especially ones that will push my skills in Python, so contact me if you'd like to share ideas!
